# Weather App

This was the second pair programming project in the course of Technigo. We built a simple weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature in Stockholm, and a 5-day forecast using a weather API. 

For this project we have worked with and simultaneously started learning about what an API is and how to use it, basic JSON, how to use fetch() and promises in JavaScript and how to work with the date() object. 

## The problem
We set up a schedule for when to work together, and also had local copies on our computers to try out code in-between our meetings, then went through it together. We have followed the steps in the project brief mostly, but did for example the 5 day forecast before setting the sunrise and sunset. We did that since it seemed to be the most complicated part and we wanted to reach the stretch goal early on in the week. 

We have spent most of the time on building the JavaScript part, and had some problems adding weather icons for different weather conditions. We then asked google, the help channel and our teammates in Slack for help. The answer was in front of our eyes at the end, in an URL for different weather conditions from openweathermap.  

Regarding the styling in css we wanted to create a similar look as one of the design examples we got with the code. We struggled a bit with the responsiveness and went back to scratch to understand the problem. The problem was really just that some parts that we didn’t set rules for in the mobile first-view (default view) was affected by the styling rules we set in the media queries. Once we figured that out it started working as we wanted. Overall we are happy with the design. If we had more time we would go back and style the sunrise-sunset part and also the forecast part a bit more.
